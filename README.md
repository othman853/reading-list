# Reading List

# Ideas
- Cheat sheets database (Which command did I use to fix this problem anyway?)
- Reading sources
- Online courses, videos and tutorials
- Store a link and give it a title
- Prioritize the links
- Categorize
- Backlog (topics I want to search about)
- Mark read links
- Store them forever (even the ones that were read)
- Search of links (by title, domain, category, etc)
