# Reading List

## Ideas

### MVP 1: Migrate from Toby Chrome Extension
- Reading resources:
  - Title: Short description
  - Source: link to the article/data
- Research topics:
  - Title: Short description about the topic

### MVP 2: Expand supported resources and operations
- Reading resources:
  - Save a new resource
  - Timestamp
  - Is Read: did I read it already?
- Research topics:
  - Save a new research topic
  - Sources: A list of harvested resources
  - Is it really important?: A flag to decide whether I should proceed researching about this topic or not
- Videos

### MVP 3: Features to help organize collected resources
- Prioritization of resources
- Categorization of resources
- Filters and sorting
- Search of resources by source or title

### Not yet prioritized:
- Learning objectives/trails
- Tooling radar (research, adopt, describe)
- Cheat sheets database (Which command did I use to fix this problem anyway?)
- Store them forever (even the ones that were read)
- Search of links (by title, domain, category, etc)
- Extract metadata on source paste
- Metrics of usage (E.g.: You read x articles this week/month/day)
- Feed of news around the world (realtime?)
- List of books

## Tech debts
- Logs
- Use Bulma from NPM instead of CDN
- Test Vue
- Adopt a linter
- ~~Stop using CDNs and learn how to serve static libs that come from npm.~~ (done)

## Improvements
- Animations and feedback
- Learn how to use babel to process front end JS.
- Start servers with PM2 or Docker compose

## Validations
- Sockets over REST
- Mongo DB Backups
- Using Bulma doesn't feel so right, perhaps there might be another approach when using web components
- Vue transition wrapper
- Emmit and treat events inside Vue (how to show error flashes?)

## Learnings
- The basics of webpack
- The basics of Vue.js
- The basics of Vuex
- The basics of Bulma

## Notable Impacts

**What are most of my resources about?**

During the development of MVP1 the UI and the tags made clear how my readings were categorized. I realized that I'm reading a lot about self improvement (and I didn't realize it before). This will impact a lot in the way I choose what to read and how I prioritize my reading.
