# Reading List

## Ideas

### MVP 1: Migrate from Toby Chrome Extension

  - Title: Short description about the topic

### MVP 2: Expand supported resources
- Reading resources:
  - Read: did I read it already?
- Research topics:
  - Sources: A list of harvested resources
  - Is it really important?: A flag to decide whether I should proceed researching about this topic or not
- Videos

### MVP 3: Features to help organize collected resources
- Prioritization of resources
- Categorization of resources
- Search of resources by source or title

### Not yet prioritized:
- Learning objectives/trails
- Tooling radar (research, adopt, describe)
- Cheat sheets database (Which command did I use to fix this problem anyway?)
- Store them forever (even the ones that were read)
- Search of links (by title, domain, category, etc)
- Extract metadata on source paste
